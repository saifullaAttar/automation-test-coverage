# Mumzworld Automation Test Coverage

**Live:** https://saifullaattar.github.io/automation-test-coverage/

Single source of truth for what the `automation_web_2.0` suite actually guards, mapped
case by case against TestMO.

* **mWeb** — [regression repository 3 / group 73697](https://mumzworld.testmo.net/repositories/3?group_id=73697).
  Read via the **run 2154** export, because that is what carries the case names; the
  repository export has no `Case` column. The build cross-checks the two: same case ids,
  same `Automated` flags, and every in-scope regression case present.
* **Native app** — [repository 241](https://mumzworld.testmo.net/repositories/241) release checklist.

## Coverage

Measured against `automation_web_2.0` **`origin/main`**.

| | Full | Partial | Not covered | In scope | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| mWeb — regression repo 3 / group 73697 | 27 | 4 | 24 | 55 | **56 %** |
| Native app — repository 241 | 9 | 14 | 6 | 29 | **79 %** |
| **Combined** | **36** | **18** | **30** | **84** | **64 %** |

Automated tests on main: **131** — 111 active, 15 hard-skipped, 5 OS-gated.
103 are verified in Arabic as well as English.

### Scope: only `Automated = YES` or `NO` counts

The `Automated` column in the TestMO export decides whether a case is an automation
candidate. Cases marked **Not planned** — Admin-side product creation, Geo-IP, push
notifications, Maya, GTM, Apple Pay — are kept in the report for reference but are
excluded from every percentage. This is the same filter as
`repositories/3?group_id=73697&filter=…custom_automated:[18,144]`.

45 of the 129 cases are excluded this way (26 mWeb + 19 app). Tick **Show *Not planned***
in the toolbar to see them; the numbers do not move.

The report now mirrors the regression repository exactly: **all 104 cases** of group 73697,
of which **55 are in scope and all 55 are mapped**. The other 49 are `Not planned` — mostly
the Returns / refunds / credit-memo area, which has no automation at all. A further 11 Admin
"Product types" cases sit outside group 73697 and are also `Not planned`, bringing the mWeb
table to 115 rows.

34 of those cases exist only in the repository export, which has no case-name column. They are
labelled with TestMO's own **Summary** text, shown in italic with a `◦` marker, and carry
`name_source: "summary"` — the report never displays a name TestMO did not write. Re-export
with the case-name column and they pick up their real names automatically.

### What "full" and "partial" mean

* **full** — every scenario in the TestMO case is covered end to end.
* **partial** — part of the case is covered, *or* the only script covering it is
  `@pytest.mark.skip`. The Evidence column always says what is and is not covered.
* **none** — nothing covers it. The Evidence column often records why, including why a
  previously-recorded link was removed.

Nothing is mapped by keyword similarity. Every link was checked by reading the test's
docstring and allure title against the TestMO case's summary and steps.

## How it works

```bash
make generate   # parse both exports + read origin/main + build + verify
make open       # generate, then open the report
```

1. `parse_testmo_csv.py` — parses a TestMO export (run layout or repository layout) and
   carries the `Automated` column through as `automated_flag` / `in_scope`. It refuses an
   export with no case-name column rather than producing rows keyed on bare ids.
2. `extract_tests.py` — reads `tests/app`, `tests/web/UAE`, `tests/web/KSA` and
   `tests/web/commons` from `origin/main` via `git show`. It never checks out or pulls,
   so your working branch in `automation_web_2.0` is left alone.
3. `build_mapping.py` — holds the case-by-case mapping and validates it. It also reads
   `REG_CSV` (the regression repository export) to tag each mWeb case with its group and to
   fail the build if the two exports ever disagree on a case's `Automated` flag, or if an
   in-scope regression case is missing from the report.
4. `verify_mapping.py` — fails the build if any invariant breaks.
5. `index.html` — the report; loads `mapping.json`.

### Test references are platform-qualified

Refs look like `app::test_uae_cart_remove_item`, not a bare test name. Ten test names
exist in two files at once — the app cart and checkout suites were ported from the web
ones and kept their names — so `test_uae_cart_remove_item` alone cannot say whether the
app or the mWeb test covers a case. Where a name repeats inside one platform, the file
stem is appended too: `web_uae::test_uae_cart_apply_gift_wrap_and_place_order@test_checkout`.

### Arabic

Arabic is a run dimension, not a second set of cases: the same suites run with `LOCALE=en`
and `LOCALE=ar`, so the case counts are unchanged. Delivered by **FALCONS-321** (app),
**FALCONS-330** (mWeb), **FALCONS-335** and **FALCONS-336** (stabilisation). `conftest.py`
maps `(COUNTRY, LOCALE)` to `/ar`, `/sa-ar`, `/bh-ar`, `/kw-ar` and `/global-ar`;
`locatorsApp.json` carries 233 locale-nested selectors. A test is marked AR-verified when
one of those tickets touched its file or the file carries locale-aware code.

## Editing the report

The report is editable in the browser:

* **+ Add test** on any row, then pick from the real inventory on main.
  A newly added link lands as **partial**, never **full** — promote it by hand once you
  have read the test and written the Evidence note.
* **×** on a tag removes a link.
* **💾 Save for Everyone** persists to the shared Gist (`37aafe3290f5c00dbd0ddb910a19f939`).
  It asks for an edit password and then for a **GitHub PAT with `gist` scope**, kept in your own
  browser's `localStorage` and never committed.

### Credentials

**This repo is public.** Anything in `index.html` is readable by every visitor, so no token is
embedded in it. Reads degrade silently without one — the committed JSON already holds everything
the report renders — and only the two write actions ("Save for Everyone", "Add Regression Run")
and "Update from Main" ask for a token.

The edit password is a speed bump against accidental edits, not access control: it is in the page
source. Treat the whole report as public, and keep anything genuinely sensitive out of it.

`.github/workflows/refresh-coverage.yml` keeps the report current without any browser credential:
CI checks out the automation repo with a read-only `AUTOMATION_REPO_TOKEN` secret, reruns
`extract_tests.py` + `build_mapping.py` + `verify_mapping.py`, and commits the result.

Structural changes (new cases, re-mapping a whole area) belong in `build_mapping.py`, not
in the browser — that file is the record of *why* each link exists.

**🔄 Update from Main** refreshes the test inventory and drops links to tests that no
longer exist. It does not create mappings. The keyword matcher that used to run here
produced links such as `Checkout – Apple pay → test_uae_checkout_cod_normal_coupon`;
it has been removed.

## What is not mapped

19 tests on main are not linked to any case. 15 of those are hard-skipped, so they guard
nothing today. The rest are UAE cart-behaviour tests (`test_uae_cart_remove_item`,
`..._increase_and_decrease_quantity`, `..._bundle_multiple_variants`,
`..._order_summary_updates_after_item_removal`, `..._add_all_product_types_and_verify` and
friends) plus `test_app_cart_existing_user_orders_no_coupon_yalla` and
`test_app_gift_registry_create_from_my_registries`.

These are real, running tests with no matching case in either TestMO source — they test cart
behaviour at a finer grain than the UF1–UF12 user flows the regression repository describes.
The fix is TestMO-side: add cases for them, or widen the existing UF cases. The report lists
them in the amber "Automated tests not linked to any case" panel so they stay visible.
